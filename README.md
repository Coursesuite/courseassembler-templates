The source code for the templates used by Course Assembler.

![Course Assembler Designs](screenshot.png)

This repository is the source code to the designs used by Course Assembler. You can download and modify the code if required.

If you use the [Coursesuite API](https://www.coursesuite.com) you can upload a zip package of a template to make it privately available through the design page programatically for your apikey. Any files other than the required files (see below) in the zip package will be persisted as-is when publishing.
